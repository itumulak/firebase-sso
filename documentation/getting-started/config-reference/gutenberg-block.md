# Gutenberg Block

If you don't feel like using the default WordPress login, you can navigate your user to log in with the Gutenberg block.

## Adding the Firebase login block

1. Create a page/post or open an existing one.
2. Add a block and search for **Firebase Login**.
3. Navigating into the block settings lets you toggle the visibility of the providers.
4. Publish or update it.
